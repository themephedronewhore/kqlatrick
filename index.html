    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <div class="line"></div>

    <p>
        Artem Nikolayevich Zelentsov was born on August 27, 2006, in Kyiv. He spent most of his life in Poltava, 
        raised by a single mother — his father did not participate in his upbringing. Over his school years, Artem attended four different schools and completed 10 grades.
    </p>

    <p>
        He first gained popularity on TikTok by posting viral lip-sync videos to tracks by 5mewmet, DJ Trippie Flameboy, and others. During this period, Artem publicly expressed opposition to the Ukrainian Armed Forces and President Volodymyr Zelensky. After leaving the country, he was met with a wave of threats and hateful messages.
    </p>

    <p>
        In 2024, Artem launched a clothing project in collaboration with Russian designer Milana Smirnova, but the collection was never released.
    </p>

    <p>In 2025, he announced a shift to avant-garde music:</p>

    <div class="quote">
        "I dress this way, and I really like how I do it. I've never felt so dark and comfortable — so I want this to be not just a style, but a new direction in music."
    </div>

    <p>
        Under the pseudonym kqlatrik, he releases music in English with French slang.
    </p>

    <div class="quote">
        "I want everyone to understand my music. English is for the world, French because France gave me the impulse to keep going."
    </div>

    <p>
        His signature tag is a scream — "merde". He has not explained why he chose this.
    </p>

    <p>
        Artem lives with an autoimmune disorder, apathy, suicidal tendencies, OCD, dyslexia, and Tourette’s syndrome.
    </p>

    <p>Living in Rennes, France, he says:</p>

    <div class="quote">
        "I won’t return. I don’t want anyone to forbid me from doing anything. I only do what doesn’t harm others."
    </div>

    <p>
        Today, kqlatrik is a fully independent international artist.
